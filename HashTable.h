//first method needs to take in two arguments, a key of type K and a value of type K and hased the key then uses a modulo operator to get the index of the bucket in which to look for values.  then it iterates through all buckets until it finds the same key 
//the second method called get takes a key of type K as its argumnt and returns a pointer to a set of values of type V that correspond with that key 
//third method getUniqueSize returns an integer representing a number of unique keys of the table
//class called HashNode contains: key type of K, set of values of type K, and a pointer to another HashNode
//constructor for HashNode takes in two arguments (key of type K and value of Type K)
